In this document we store the project ticklist as well as evidence of team work

***********************************************************************
PROJECT TICK LIST

# Guidelines from the assignment:
[x] Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table.  

[x]  Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by 
defining "div" tags for the content.  

[x]  Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content.  

[x]  Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.  
      ** (media will be considered again in CSS section of project)

    
### Step 1: 
[x] Markup Wireframes with HTML (Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.)  

### Step 2: 
[x] Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself  

[x]  Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to 
   understand the code.  
   
[x] Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the 
   correct HTML tags.  
   
[x]  Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes.  

[x] It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure 
   you can work together as a team. **We will use commit log to ensure this**  
   
### Step 3: 
[x] Validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/  

   
## Review Criteria
We are looking for a well constructed skeleton that reflects the design in the wireframes and for content that is relevant and appropriate.

#### Marks will be awarded for the following:

[deployment_deliverable]  Does the URL lead to the correct website?  

[x]  Appropriate semantic tags used, both the predefined tags and the appropriate use of div block tags.  

[x]  The range of different layout, formatting and media HTML tags used and their appropriate use (eg tables used as tables not for layout)  

[x]  Rich comments  

[x]  Accessibility, particularly in the use of the media tags.  

[x]  Tidy directory structure.

TEAM WORK EVIDENCE

Throughput the project the team worked well together. 
Below please find some of the slack conversations as evidence. 


In this channel we identify team members for specific tasks, all team members to continuously review and upgrade each other work.
Please comment here if you made any changes or if you have suggestions for changes to the code base ( suggest changes if you do not think it is appropriate to just make them ).
Please be active in this channel  so that we have a record of what is going on.
As agreed I will outline a high level distribution of tasks.
TASKS
Getting started:
ALL do final review of wireframes and confirm you are happy with a comment in this channel.
@Andy  code first two pages based on our  first assignment wire frames.
@Mariyasha888  code the contact page.
Once we have the 3 web pages:
@Mo add comments to the HTML to help developers understand the code and to relate it to the wireframes
@Mo  conrinously compare the three pages and check that we use markup consistently across the website
@Istvan Bacskai please add images to the wireframe including alternative text.
ALL start adding some text to the wireframes as you see fit.
@Vicus Brits research how to make the site more accessible to blind users and make updates where applicable
ALL continuously review the entire project and record what you did as well as suggestions here.
@Mariyasha888  make and add a website logo image.
@Mo  make sure all parts of the website has a semantic identity.
@Istvan Bacskai consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information and make changes and/or provide feedback here.
@Vicus Brits  continuously review project code and project progress against the project brief and provide status updates here.
@Istvan Bacskai  and @Mo  review our website against W3C webpages and look for HTML elements we can incorporate.
@Andy take ownership of HTML, continuously review code , Andy has final decision on what the HTML looks like and may accept or reject any changes.
Then:
@Mariyasha888  update wireframes with HTML tags ( once we are ready to submit)
@Vicus Brits add comments on how we collaborated to the HTML.
@Mariyasha888 once work is  complete , create zip folder share and upload!

Andy  3:09 AM
I've completed my part. One thing that still needs to be done is the footer should be improved to include more links like you see on most websites.
3:11
You should check my work for div classes that can be reused like the banner, header section and secondary header. It will be easier to add css styles later if we reuse a few classes.
3:11
i'm just going to add a few more comments now and i'm done.
3:16
it also needs to have some links added. i made notes

Vicus Brits  7:36 AM
Thanks @Andy.
I have added some text to the attractions page, this makes it a bit more real. All, please feel free to change the content as the site evolves.
Team, Andy added notes : "e,g, Someone should add targets for the buttons" for us to action.

Mo  12:01 PM
I've just completed adding comments to the proposed Attractions page.

Mariyasha888  6:28 PM
I've just uploaded the contact page

Vicus Brits  8:12 PM
I did research on how to make site more accessible for visually impaired people.
1) Make use of header tags.
2) Provide alternative text for pictures and buttons. 
3) Make sure you can click through with a keyboard.
4) Provide a skip link, (we can implement once we add CSS).
8:13
I updated the index page with alt tags to assist the visually impaired.

Our website incorporates 3/4 of the structuring guides provided by the W3C:     
·      Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
·      Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
·      Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
·      Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

Hey guys, I've started adding photos to the image folder in the repository, I've photoshopped them to match our theme (they're not as realistic as can be, but they convey the message).
If you like them, please place them on your pages :slightly_smiling_face:
8:34
Mo you're right, we can add a video to the planning page (or even the attractions page, because space travel is one hell of a ride XD)

Mariyasha888  8:48 AM
Actually, a better suggestion, maybe we can include an article about what space travel does to a human body? something about preparing for the trip?

Mo  8:56 AM
Hola, really cool pictures :grinning::+1:! Disney Land has an awesome video banner https://disneyland.disney.go.com/destinations/disneyland/star-wars-galaxys-edge/, but we don't have any footage so I think that an embedded informative video from Youtube ( about what space travel does to a human body, something about preparing for the trip) would also serve the purpose.

Mariyasha888  7:48 PM
Finished the planning page! (including the photos) :tada::confetti_ball:
I also couldn't help but add a tiny bit of CSS to demonstrate that our promo banners would take up the full page width...
I'm worried people won't understand why we have all these promos in between the content, but if we add a background colour to the divs - it actually looks like the separator it's mean to represent. What do you guys think?

Vicus Brits  7:55 PM
Added alt tags to the other pages to improve access for the visually impaired.

Vicus Brits  8:15 PM
I think on the question of CCS, perhaps we go with adding a CSS file and start with the styling formally, surely there won't be negative marks for style :slightly_smiling_face:.
8:19
I removed duplicate 'name' meta tags as well as the alt tags which someone (:face_with_raised_eyebrow: me) added incorrectly to the <a> elements.
Take some time to validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/, it is a cool tool!

Andy  2:36 PM
I just blended the pages together. In 24hrs from now, we can consider these final versions. Make any changes you want in the meantime. I apologize if I removed anything that you think should be in there. If you feel that way, please add the thing back in. This time tomorrow night, I will review it all for consistency. @Vicus Brits to assign wrap up tasks.
2:36
Some tasks that need to be assigned:
Linking
Adding purchase section to index page (I can do this)
Link pages to each other (especially buttons on index)
Review grading criteria, check checklist in README
Checking all images
Review tags used
Markup wireframes (this should have done before we started anything :p)
Anything else?
(edited)

Vicus Brits  6:26 PM
Updated href navigation links
Linked buttons on index.html to specific page sections

Mariyasha888  6:38 PM
We have a logo now! :slightly_smiling_face:
I wasn't sure what the existing logo.png in the folder was for, so I kept it there and just used MoonshotLogo.png for naming
https://github.com/web-development-5-vhz/webdev-spring2020/blob/master/images/MoonshotLogo.png
The wireframes should be ready by nighttime in Vancouver

3) Created unique names for duplicate 'id' tags
4) Removed 'Frameborder' and 'scrolling' elements from iframes, needs to be CSS

Weird, it seems like I redid some of @Vicus Brits changes and more. Close a hundred changes total! Everyone should install the "W3C Validation" add-on to VSC. (edited) 

Andy  2:38 PM
Updated readme to include a checklist. @Vicus Brits @Mo @Mariyasha888 please read the checklist and tick (put x in the [ ]) the things that you were responsible for or know are there. For example, I heard mention of embedding video but haven't seen it. Have we included a variety of media?
