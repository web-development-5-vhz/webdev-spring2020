# Guidelines from the assignment:
[x] Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table.  

[x]  Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by 
defining "div" tags for the content.  

[x]  Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content.  

[ ]  Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.  


    
### Step 1: 
[ ] Markup Wireframes with HTML (Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.)  

### Step 2: 
[x] Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself  

[x]  Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to 
   understand the code.  
   
[x] Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the 
   correct HTML tags.  
   
[x]  Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes.  

[ ] It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure 
   you can work together as a team. **We will use commit log to ensure this**  
   
### Step 3: 
[x] Validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/  

   
## Review Criteria
We are looking for a well constructed skeleton that reflects the design in the wireframes and for content that is relevant and appropriate.

#### Marks will be awarded for the following:

[ ]  Does the URL lead to the correct website?
[x]  Appropriate semantic tags used, both the predefined tags and the appropriate use of div block tags.  

[ ]  The range of different layout, formatting and media HTML tags used and their appropriate use (eg tables used as tables not for layout)  

[ ]  Rich comments  

[ ]  Accessibility, particularly in the use of the media tags.  

[x]  Tidy directory structure.
