Assignment 2 TICK LIST

# Guidelines from the assignment:
#### Markup wireframes with Appearance CSS

Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the appearance that you wish your site to have. Ensure that you have agreed the colours that will be applied to the elements. Agree the font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site, and the colours that should be used.

Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and add classes and identities to the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload a .zip file of these new marked-up versions of the wireframes into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.

#### Set up and link stylesheet

Code the CSS stylesheet with these appearance styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.

#### Upload the pages to the static web page system

Upload your three new versions of HTML pages to the Workspace: static web page system in week 10 with the class and id properties and the CSS stylesheet within a tidy directory structure. Test that everything is working as expected by loading the pages in a browser using the shareable URL for your web site.

<em>We are looking for evidence of application of the various appearance and text styling CSS using the CSS Box Model.</em>

#### Marks will be awarded for the following:

[ ] Does the URL lead to the correct website?  
[ ] Applying Appearance Styling: Stylesheets  
[ ] Applying Appearance Styling - Styling Text  
[ ] Applying Appearance Styling - Font Families  
[ ] Applying Appearance Styling - HTML Object Colouring  
[ ] Applying Appearance Styling - Colour Definition

TEAM WORK EVIDENCE

Throughput the project the team worked well together. 
Below please find some of the slack conversations as evidence. 


In this channel we identify team members for specific tasks, all team members to continuously review and upgrade each other work.
Please comment here if you made any changes or if you have suggestions for changes to the code base ( suggest changes if you do not think it is appropriate to just make them ).
Please be active in this channel  so that we have a record of what is going on.
As agreed I will outline a high level distribution of tasks.
TASKS
Getting started:
ALL do final review of wireframes and confirm you are happy with a comment in this channel.
@Andy  code first two pages based on our  first assignment wire frames.
@Mariyasha888  code the contact page.
Once we have the 3 web pages:
@Mo add comments to the HTML to help developers understand the code and to relate it to the wireframes
@Mo  conrinously compare the three pages and check that we use markup consistently across the website
@Istvan Bacskai please add images to the wireframe including alternative text.
ALL start adding some text to the wireframes as you see fit.
@Vicus Brits research how to make the site more accessible to blind users and make updates where applicable
ALL continuously review the entire project and record what you did as well as suggestions here.
@Mariyasha888  make and add a website logo image.
@Mo  make sure all parts of the website has a semantic identity.
@Istvan Bacskai consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information and make changes and/or provide feedback here.
@Vicus Brits  continuously review project code and project progress against the project brief and provide status updates here.
@Istvan Bacskai  and @Mo  review our website against W3C webpages and look for HTML elements we can incorporate.
@Andy take ownership of HTML, continuously review code , Andy has final decision on what the HTML looks like and may accept or reject any changes.
Then:
@Mariyasha888  update wireframes with HTML tags ( once we are ready to submit)
@Vicus Brits add comments on how we collaborated to the HTML.
@Mariyasha888 once work is  complete , create zip folder share and upload!

Andy  3:09 AM
I've completed my part. One thing that still needs to be done is the footer should be improved to include more links like you see on most websites.
3:11
You should check my work for div classes that can be reused like the banner, header section and secondary header. It will be easier to add css styles later if we reuse a few classes.
3:11
i'm just going to add a few more comments now and i'm done.
3:16
it also needs to have some links added. i made notes

Vicus Brits  7:36 AM
Thanks @Andy.
I have added some text to the attractions page, this makes it a bit more real. All, please feel free to change the content as the site evolves.
Team, Andy added notes : "e,g, Someone should add targets for the buttons" for us to action.

Mo  12:01 PM
I've just completed adding comments to the proposed Attractions page.

Mariyasha888  6:28 PM
I've just uploaded the contact page

Vicus Brits  8:12 PM
I did research on how to make site more accessible for visually impaired people.
1) Make use of header tags.
2) Provide alternative text for pictures and buttons. 
3) Make sure you can click through with a keyboard.
4) Provide a skip link, (we can implement once we add CSS).
8:13
I updated the index page with alt tags to assist the visually impaired.

Our website incorporates 3/4 of the structuring guides provided by the W3C:     
·      Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
·      Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
·      Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
·      Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

Hey guys, I've started adding photos to the image folder in the repository, I've photoshopped them to match our theme (they're not as realistic as can be, but they convey the message).
If you like them, please place them on your pages :slightly_smiling_face:
8:34
Mo you're right, we can add a video to the planning page (or even the attractions page, because space travel is one hell of a ride XD)

Mariyasha888  8:48 AM
Actually, a better suggestion, maybe we can include an article about what space travel does to a human body? something about preparing for the trip?

Mo  8:56 AM
Hola, really cool pictures :grinning::+1:! Disney Land has an awesome video banner https://disneyland.disney.go.com/destinations/disneyland/star-wars-galaxys-edge/, but we don't have any footage so I think that an embedded informative video from Youtube ( about what space travel does to a human body, something about preparing for the trip) would also serve the purpose.

Mariyasha888  7:48 PM
Finished the planning page! (including the photos) :tada::confetti_ball:
I also couldn't help but add a tiny bit of CSS to demonstrate that our promo banners would take up the full page width...
I'm worried people won't understand why we have all these promos in between the content, but if we add a background colour to the divs - it actually looks like the separator it's mean to represent. What do you guys think?

Vicus Brits  7:55 PM
Added alt tags to the other pages to improve access for the visually impaired.

Vicus Brits  8:15 PM
I think on the question of CCS, perhaps we go with adding a CSS file and start with the styling formally, surely there won't be negative marks for style :slightly_smiling_face:.
8:19
I removed duplicate 'name' meta tags as well as the alt tags which someone (:face_with_raised_eyebrow: me) added incorrectly to the <a> elements.
Take some time to validate the code in the pages: https://validator.w3.org/, it is a cool tool!

Andy  2:36 PM
I just blended the pages together. In 24hrs from now, we can consider these final versions. Make any changes you want in the meantime. I apologize if I removed anything that you think should be in there. If you feel that way, please add the thing back in. This time tomorrow night, I will review it all for consistency. @Vicus Brits to assign wrap up tasks.
2:36
Some tasks that need to be assigned:
Linking
Adding purchase section to index page (I can do this)
Link pages to each other (especially buttons on index)
Review grading criteria, check checklist in README
Checking all images
Review tags used
Markup wireframes (this should have done before we started anything :p)
Anything else?
(edited)

Vicus Brits  6:26 PM
Updated href navigation links
Linked buttons on index.html to specific page sections

Mariyasha888  6:38 PM
We have a logo now! :slightly_smiling_face:
I wasn't sure what the existing logo.png in the folder was for, so I kept it there and just used MoonshotLogo.png for naming
https://github.com/web-development-5-vhz/webdev-spring2020/blob/master/images/MoonshotLogo.png
The wireframes should be ready by nighttime in Vancouver

Weird, it seems like I redid some of @Vicus Brits changes and more. Close a hundred changes total! Everyone should install the "W3C Validation" add-on to VSC. (edited) 

Andy  2:38 PM
Updated readme to include a checklist. @Vicus Brits @Mo @Mariyasha888 please read the checklist and tick (put x in the [ ]) the things that you were responsible for or know are there. For example, I heard mention of embedding video but haven't seen it. Have we included a variety of media?

Andy  3:16 PM
Comments verified!

Istvan 9:39 PM
Added favicon and change the 'Lorem Ipsum' on the planning page
